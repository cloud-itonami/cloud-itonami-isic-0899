  "The governor contract as executable end-to-end tests, driven through
  the full langgraph-clj `quarryops.operation` StateGraph (intake ->
  advise -> govern -> decide -> commit | hold | request-approval). The
  single invariant under test:

    QuarryOpsAdvisor never commits a proposal the QuarrySiteGovernor
    would reject, `:flag-environmental-concern` ALWAYS interrupts for
    human sign-off (never auto, at any phase), and every decision
    (commit OR hold) leaves exactly one ledger fact."
